## Sprint focus 

This sprint, the team is focusing on three key areas:
* SKALE manager improvements 
* QA integration and end-to-end testing on our testnet stack
* Bug squashing and hardening

## Standing work

Here is multi-week work that the team is working through:
* Two parallel and separate security audits related to Token Launch

> First responses have been received and the team is working towards first response remediation. These reports will be make public after the remediation phases are complete.

* Testnet design and structure

> SKALE Network will conduct a testnet prior to token launch with key validator partners. Once the first set of testnet activities are complete, mainnet is planned to launch in parallel with a new testnet.

* Documentation improvements

> SKALE Labs is adding documentation for dApp Developers, validators, and open source contributors.
