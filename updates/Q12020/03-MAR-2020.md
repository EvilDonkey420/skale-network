## Sprint focus

This sprint, the team is focusing on three key areas:

-   SKALE manager improvements and audit re-mediation
-   QA testing on our internal testnet stack
-   Bug squashing and hardening

## Standing work

Here is multi-week work that the core team is working through:

-   Two parallel and separate security audits related to Token Launch

> Team has begun re-mediation and re-audit discussions based on the first round of audit reports. Some major refactoring and minor changes have been performed to further optimize gas usage and improve security throughout the SKALE Manager system.

-   Testnets

> QA team is rapidly evolving internal testnets on a daily basis with new fixes and improvements. 
> SKALE Network will conduct a testnet prior to token launch with key validator partners. Once the first set of testnet activities are complete, mainnet is planned to launch in parallel with a new testnet.

-   Documentation improvements

> [SGXWallet documentation is restructured and improved.](https://github.com/skalenetwork/sgxwallet)
> SKALE Labs will continue to improve documentation for validators.

## New initiatives

Bug bounty program for SKALE consensus and other repositories will be launching soon on HackerOne. More details to follow.
