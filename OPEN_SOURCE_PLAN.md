# SKALE Open Source Plan and Community

SKALE would be nothing without the open source community - we stand on the shoulders of giants. As we begin the process of open sourcing everything, we'd like to extend a thank you to everyone in the community who has made our technology possible. We'd also like to extend a special show of appreciation to the Aleth Project (which our skaled code is based on) and its many contributors.

Most projects in this space led with a whitepaper and followed up (or not) with execution. We are fortunate to have investors who recognized that shipping and open sourcing were a higher priority and allowed us to focus on those items, first.

And with the liberty to focus on shipping, we made sure to work as efficiently and effectively as possible. Over the course of many months, the team and related processes evolved and changed with everyone's ability to prepare for open sourcing - it was a messy. So, we decided to clear the commit histories of our repositories so that we could meet some minimums for clean and secure code practices.

We're still working on improving and cleaning things up, and as a result, we're executing a phased open sourcing process to ensure that we ship the best code for the community to begin contributing to.

Dates are tentative (as with any software development), but here are the things we intend to release in the near future (in no particular order).

## What to Expect from SKALE Network in the Future

There's a lot of code, but we're not done yet! And we'd love for YOU to contribute! If you're new and just getting acquainted with the codebase, a few areas where you could provide immense value include:

-   All things testing and CI / CD to ensure healthy repositories.
-   Example repositories building on SKALE.
-   Documentation on how to use SKALE.

For more code-specific action items, there will be plenty of Github issues which we would greatly appreciate assistance with!
